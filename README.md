# Odin Recipes

This is a simple web project for The Odin Project. It demonstrates basic HTML and CSS skills by creating a small recipe website.

The homepage displays a list of recipes with images. Each recipe has its own page showing a description, ingredients, and steps. The design is clean and modern, with easy navigation.

To view the site, open `index.html` in your browser and click any recipe card to see more details.
